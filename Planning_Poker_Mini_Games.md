## 🎮 Mini-Game Options

### 1. **Complexity Bingo**
**During:** Story explanation
**How it works:**
- Each participant gets a bingo card with common story elements
- Mark squares as they hear keywords/concepts mentioned
- First to get a line wins small points
- Encourages active listening!

**Bingo Squares Examples:**
```
| API Call | Database | Frontend | Testing | DevOps |
| User Story | Edge Case | Third Party | Security | Performance |
| Validation | Error Handling | Mobile | Cache | Migration |
```

### 2. **Estimation Prediction**
**During:** Story explanation  
**How it works:**
- While listening, players secretly predict what others will vote
- Submit predictions before actual voting
- Points for accurate predictions about teammates
- Creates social awareness and listening focus

**Interface:**
- Small widget showing team member avatars
- Quick tap to assign predicted story points to each person
- Reveal predictions after actual voting

---

### 3. **Keyword Spotting**
**During:** Story explanation
**How it works:**
- Real-time collaborative word cloud building
- Tap important keywords as you hear them
- Most-tapped words get bigger in shared cloud
- Helps identify key story components together

**Benefits:**
- Visual summary of story priorities
- Keeps everyone actively listening
- Creates shared understanding
- Can reference cloud during discussion

---

### 4. **Quick Polls**
**During:** Story explanation
**How it works:**
- Story explainer can trigger instant micro-polls
- "Is this frontend or backend heavy?" 
- "How risky does this sound? 🟢🟡🔴"
- "Any similar stories we've done?"
- Real-time emoji/reaction responses

---

### 5. **Attention Meter**
**During:** Story explanation
**How it works:**
- Shared "engagement thermometer" 
- Participants can boost meter by reacting to key points
- Visual feedback for presenter about audience attention
- Gamifies active listening

**Mechanics:**
- Meter goes up with emoji reactions to important points
- Falls slowly over time without engagement
- Goal: Keep meter in "green zone" throughout explanation

---

### 6. **Silent Questions Queue**
**During:** Story explanation
**How it works:**
- Submit questions silently during explanation
- Others can upvote questions they also have
- Presenter sees most popular questions
- Address top questions after explanation

**Interface:**
- Small question input box
- List of submitted questions with vote counts
- Prevents interruptions while capturing all concerns

---

### 7. **Story Element Checklist**
**During:** Story explanation
**How it works:**
- Collaborative checklist of story completeness
- Team marks off: Acceptance Criteria ✓, Dependencies ✓, etc.
- Visual indicator of story readiness
- Red flags show missing information

**Checklist Items:**
- ✓ Clear acceptance criteria
- ✓ Dependencies identified  
- ✓ UI/UX requirements clear
- ✓ Testing approach defined
- ✓ Risks discussed

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Integration with Existing Flow
```
1. Start Planning Session (existing)
2. Story Explanation Begins
   → Mini-game widget appears
   → Real-time interaction during explanation
3. Explanation Ends
   → Mini-game results/summary shown
   → Transition to voting (existing)
4. Voting & Discussion (existing)
```

### UI Design Principles
- **Non-intrusive**: Small widget that doesn't block main content
- **Silent interaction**: No audio disruptions
- **Quick engagement**: Single taps/clicks, no complex interactions
- **Shared visibility**: Everyone sees collective results
- **Easy dismiss**: Can be minimized if not wanted

### Firebase Integration
- Real-time updates for collaborative elements
- Store mini-game preferences per room
- Track engagement metrics
- Sync results across all participants

## 🎨 User Experience

### Widget Placement
- Small floating panel in corner
- Expandable but doesn't cover main story content
- Always accessible but not demanding attention
- Clean, minimal design

### Interaction Patterns
- **Tap to engage**: Simple one-touch interactions
- **Passive participation**: Can listen without playing
- **Visual feedback**: See others' participation in real-time
- **No pressure**: Optional engagement, no penalties for not playing

interface KeywordGame {
  roomId: string;
  isActive: boolean;
  keywords: {
    [word: string]: {
      count: number;
      submittedBy: string[];
    }
  };
}

const KeywordSpotter = () => {
  const [currentWord, setCurrentWord] = useState('');
  const [wordCloud, setWordCloud] = useState<WordCloudData>([]);
  
  const submitKeyword = () => {
    // Add to Firebase real-time
    // Update shared word cloud
    // Visual feedback for submission
  };
  
  return (
    <div className="keyword-spotter">
      <h4>Key Words Spotted</h4>
      <WordCloud data={wordCloud} />
      <input 
        value={currentWord}
        onChange={(e) => setCurrentWord(e.target.value)}
        onKeyPress={(e) => e.key === 'Enter' && submitKeyword()}
        placeholder="Hear a key term? Add it!"
      />
